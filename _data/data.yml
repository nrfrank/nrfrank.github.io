      for sports book customers, generating [$500k of new business](https://sportshandle.com/william-hill-stats-perform-prop-deal/)
      in the first six months. Oversaw on-time completion of deadlines for the NBA & NFL 2018-19 playoffs as well as 2019-20 season,
      requiring delivery of 11 new models into production while automating existing manual process for legacy products.
      - Drove development of an internal TensorFlow based model development framework with packages for dataset generation, versioning
      and metadata management, architecture definition and training, and deployment to a TensorFlow Serving RESTful API in AWS Fargate.
      - Provide technical oversight of the VQ product: Java Spark ETL pipeline, model development, cloud infrastructure (AWS), human-in-theloop
      interface and both internal and client-facing APIs. Guide story definition and refinement; lead weekly/quarterly planning sessions.
      - Aide design and creation of cloud data lake (AWS S3, Glue & Athena), reducing cost and easing access to historical data archived in on
      premise Oracle databases. Develop methods to query the data lake, process and split the result into datasets and store in S3.

  - role: Data Scientist
    time: Jan. 2017 - Jan. 2019
    company: STATS LLC, Chicago
    details: |
      - STATS Prediction as a Service (PaaS): Co-author tools integrating ETL pipelines to deliver data to the cloud (AWS S3), generate datasets
      from queries executed at scale (AWS Athena), train TensorFlow models in Docker and deploy to a HTTP RESTful API endpoint (TensorFlow
      Serving with AWS SageMaker, Lambda & API Gateway). Submit to inaugural VCG AI/ML Hackathon and win most disruptive entry.
      - [STATS Edge](https://www.statsperform.com/team-performance/football/edge-analysis/):
      Refactor legacy data science pipeline and deploy existing scikit-learn models to Flask APIs. Contribute to Apache Spark ETL
      pipeline in a paired programming (XP) setting. [Optimize](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.13107.pdf) existing models, reducing runtime by an order of magnitude.
      - [NBA Live Win Probability](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2011.pdf):
      Achieved SOTA accuracy (88%) predicting end of game outcomes for NBA games given in-game context
      through the use of embedding techniques. Process and release a curated dataset containing 352 features of over 8.7M NBA plays from
      the 2002-03 through 2016-17 seasons. Present work at 2018 Sloan Sports Analytics Conference.
      - [STATS Insights](https://www.statsperform.com/media-and-tech/viewer-engagement/):
      Used LSI, LDA and other topic modeling techniques to classify ∼80k human generated media notes, learning templates
      to automate nearly half (44% ). Delivered 546 automated notes using custom Jinja-based templates for Allstate’s March Mayhem campaign
      during the 2017 NCAA Tournament. Used learned templates to generate >19k notes across 10 international soccer leagues.
