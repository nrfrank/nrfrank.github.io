### Summary

A practical, no-fluff walkthrough of how to take ML from experiments to reliable production systems. It reframes MLOps through an SRE/DevOps lens—standardized environments, CI/CD, observability, data/model versioning, evaluation, and governance—while calling out people/process pitfalls and offering paved-road starting points to help teams ship faster with guardrails.

**_Key topics & takeaways_**

- Treat ML as software engineering with data/models: standardize environments and enforce CI/CD.
- Build observability beyond infra: monitor data quality, drift, model performance, and user impact.
- Use “paved roads” (starter repos, templates, golden paths) to move from bespoke to repeatable.
- Clarify ownership and handoffs across DS/MLE/Platform/SRE; translate across role language gaps.
- Make governance practical: align with security/architecture so the “right way” is the easy way.
