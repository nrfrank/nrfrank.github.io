## Nathan Frank - ML Platform & Operations Leader

I’m an engineering and AI/ML leader who builds platforms that teams actually use. My work sits at the intersection of **_ML engineering, platform productization, and people-first leadership_**, translating between data science, engineering, security, and business stakeholders so teams can ship faster **with guardrails**.

### How I got here

I began in **_astrophysics_**, completing an **_M.S. in Physics & Astronomy at UNC–Chapel Hill_** after an honors **_B.S. in Physics (Astrophysics) at UC Santa Cruz_**.
Research taught me to reason from noisy data, model complex systems, and communicate clearly.
From there I moved into **_data science and applied ML_**, then into **_sports technology_**, where I helped build predictive products and the ML platform foundations that supported them.

That experience led me deeper into **_ML platforms_** (training, serving, observability, governance) and **_consulting_** with a focus on **_ML engineering and productization_** across a variety of clients and use cases.
Today, at **_Grainger_**, I lead **_Machine Learning Platform & Operations_**, guiding a manager-of-managers organization to scale responsible AI adoption across many teams.

### What I focus on

- **_Platform productization:_** Databricks + Kubernetes; production-grade model serving; retrieval & search; multi-provider LLM access; data/feature governance.
- **_Enablement & adoption:_** self-service onboarding, paved-road patterns, internal consulting, training, and best-practice playbooks.
- **_Responsible AI:_** practical governance and risk controls with security/architecture so the “right way” is the easy way.
- **_Org leadership:_** hiring and mentoring; developing new managers; building high-retention, diverse teams with clear ownership and healthy feedback loops.

[//]: # '### Selected highlights'
[//]: # '- Compressed complex **migrations** and modernization timelines while maintaining service reliability.'
[//]: # '- Turned platform onboarding from **weeks to days** via automation and cross-functional process design.'
[//]: # '- Introduced an internal AI assistant that resolved a significant share of support questions end-to-end, freeing people for higher-value work.'
[//]: # '- Grew platform adoption across many teams by balancing performance, cost, and governance—**platforms as products**, not just infrastructure.'

### Speaking & media

I speak about **_enterprise MLOps_**, **_AI enablement_**, and the human side of shipping ML on podcasts, at internal/external events, and with local communities.
