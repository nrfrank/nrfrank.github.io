### Workshop Overview

This hands-on workshop brings software testing discipline to Python data science and machine learning workflows. Participants learn practical, copy-pasteable patterns that improve code quality and development speed without adding friction to data exploration and model development.

**_Workshop content includes_**

- Sensible testing defaults and when TDD actually helps data teams
- Project setup and testing framework configuration for PyData stack
- Unit and integration testing patterns for Pandas, NumPy, and PySpark
- Data validation and drift detection in testing pipelines
- Effective use of fixtures and mocking for data workflows
- CI/CD basics tailored for data and ML projects
- Real-world examples and troubleshooting common testing challenges

This workshop bridges the gap between software engineering best practices and the unique needs of data science and ML development teams.
