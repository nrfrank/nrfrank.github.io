### Talk Overview

This presentation demystifies MLOps by connecting it to well-established DevOps and SRE practices, while clearly identifying what makes machine learning systems unique. It provides practical guidance for teams transitioning from ML experiments to production systems.

**_Key topics covered_**

- Mapping MLOps challenges to proven DevOps/SRE solutions
- Common workflow pitfalls in ML system development
- Effective team communication strategies across DS/ML/Engineering roles
- Simple, confidence-building starting points for MLOps adoption
- What makes ML systems genuinely different from traditional software

This talk helps bridge the gap between data science experimentation and reliable production ML systems.
