A practical talk focused on the real-world challenges teams face when moving machine learning models from development to production.
Drawing from experience at WW Grainger, this presentation covers common pitfalls in ML operationalization and provides actionable solutions for building robust MLOps practices.

## Key Topics Covered

- **ML Development Workflow**: Understanding the unique challenges of machine learning development versus traditional software development
- **Team Dynamics**: Communication patterns between data scientists, ML engineers, and platform teams
- **Operational Perspective**: Applying SRE and DevOps principles to machine learning systems
- **Practical Solutions**: Simple, implementable approaches to common MLOps problems

This talk is particularly valuable for teams beginning their MLOps journey and looking for practical guidance rather than theoretical frameworks.
